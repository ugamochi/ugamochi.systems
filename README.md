## Quick Start

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Or just open index.html directly
open index.html
```

3. **Visit:** `http://localhost:8000`

### No Build Process Required

This is a static HTML website with no build dependencies. The entire site is contained in `index.html`.

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form is currently in development mode. To enable it:

### Stage 1: Basic Email Notifications

See **[docs/N8N_SETUP_STAGE1.md](docs/N8N_SETUP_STAGE1.md)** for the full walkthrough.

**Quick summary:**
1. Create n8n cloud account at https://cloud.n8n.io
2. Configure Gmail OAuth2 credential
3. Create webhook workflow (Webhook -> Set -> Gmail x2)
4. Replace `YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` in `index.html` line ~2543
5. Test and deploy

### Stage 2-4: Advanced Features

See `docs/FORM_SETUP.md` (to be created) for:
- Google Sheets integration
- AI lead scoring
- Automated personalized responses

## Deployment

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

5. Add custom domain: `pavel.systems`

### Option 2: Vercel

vercel
```

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting

1. Upload `index.html` to your web server
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled

## Content Sections

2. **Hero** - Value proposition + proof metrics (40+ systems, 90%, <24h)
3. **Problem** - Client pain points (3 cards)
4. **Services** - 6 service offerings with metrics and tech tags

## Customization

### Update Colors

Edit CSS custom properties in `:root` (line 30):
```css
:root {
  --bg: #0b0b0b;              /* Background */
  --bg-card: #161616;          /* Card surfaces */
  --text-primary: #e7e6d9;    /* Warm cream text */
  --text-secondary: #b9b8ae;  /* Secondary text */
  --accent: #6236f4;          /* Violet accent (light bg) */
  --accent-light: #a17ff7;    /* Light violet (dark bg text) */
}
```

### Analytics

Plausible is already included. To disable, remove the script from `index.html`.

### og-image (Social Previews)

`og-image.svg` is used for link previews. Some platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn) prefer PNG—if previews fail, screenshot `og-image.html` at 1200×630, save as `og-image.png`, and update the `og:image` and `twitter:image` meta tags to point to it.
